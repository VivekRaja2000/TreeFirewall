# TreeFirewall

## About this project
Internet is currently playing major role in all the fields ranging from education to banking and even satellite launching. Internet security is more important but the cost to ensure the security is more and it is not always affordable for low budget devices. We have the firewalls to provide security at each level of internet from end devices, routers and even servers. But, cost to establish and maintain is more difficult and it is only suitable for general purpose securities not for the specific user domain. To make the firewall for specific user domain, it too can be compromised as developers make the firewall to be modified easily as this small user domain requirements changes fast when compared to the general public usage. The in-built security for devices requires more complex design of system and that won’t suit for Internet of Things (IOT) and educational devices. For the quality education, we need to ensure the internet security which allows students to focus only on studies and don’t require separate monitoring of students along with low cost. So, we provide a system with built-in software defined security for the devices with lower power and with only need to access only specific servers or inter-connected devices by means of a firewall whose rules cannot be modified even by the user-level programs and to make the firewall work faster, we implement the firewall using a tree structure to store and process rules.
